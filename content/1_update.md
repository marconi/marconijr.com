Summary: Update on what have I been doing with a minor attempt in instilling another way to look at your job :)

So its 2013 already and its been months since my last blog post and I have three items I want to share. First off, I figured with this year I'll start blogging again but switched from using [Mingus](https://github.com/montylounge/django-mingus) to [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/) to power this blog mainly because its easier and lightweight.

Second, my last post was in Jan. 02 when I stopped the development on [Trade or Sale](http://tradeorsale.ph/). Unfortunately I won't be migrating the old blog post from Mingus so there's no way to reach those old posts now. 

Third and the last item, since Feb. 01 of this year I've already started working as a Software Engineer for a company called [Sprofila](http://www.sprofila.com/), its an Australian startup that focuses on sports. Right now we're working on platform for football called [FootySprofila](http://footysprofila.com/) and this month is the last month of my three months probationary period and if everything goes well, I'll be going full-time starting on May.

That's it for my three items and I'm quite happy with my work right now, despite the painful ending of my 2012 to the start of this year and my failed project, I'm still thankful I managed to land a job where people  give value to what I do and not see me as typical clock-puncher to their company.

If you're working for someone, make sure you're doing it for the right reasons. You'll never get those time back and money can only take you so far.
